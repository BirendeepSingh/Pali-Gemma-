# PaliGemma Vision Language Model

## Overview
PaliGemma is a custom-built multimodal vision language model designed to integrate and interpret visual and textual data using transformer architectures. This project demonstrates core concepts such as embeddings, positional encoding, multi-head attention, feed-forward layers, and Vision Transformer techniques. It also incorporates contrastive learning approaches like CLIP and SigLip, along with advanced optimization techniques for enhanced performance.

## Features
- **Transformer Architecture:** Implements embeddings, positional encoding, multi-head attention, feed-forward layers, logits, and softmax.
- **Vision Integration:** Combines Vision Transformer components to process image data alongside text.
- **Contrastive Learning:** Enhances cross-modal feature learning using methods like CLIP and SigLip.
- **Advanced Optimizations:** Uses rotary positional embeddings, grouped query attention, and normalization layers (Batch, Layer, RMS) for improved stability and performance.
- **Efficient Generation:** Leverages KV-cache, attention masks, weight tying, top-p sampling, and temperature control to optimize inference.
